# Tracking-Breast-Cancer-Severity

This project is the development of end-to-end data pipeline that follows CRISP-DM strategy

CRISP-DM stands for "Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining." It's a widely-recognized methodology providing a structured approach for planning, organizing, and executing data mining projects. The CRISP-DM methodology consists of six major phases:

#### Business Understanding:
This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective. It involves defining the problem, understanding the business's objectives, and formulating a preliminary plan to achieve those objectives.

#### Data Understanding: 
Here, the focus is on collecting the data and familiarizing oneself with it. This includes tasks such as data loading, data exploration, and data quality assessment.

#### Data Preparation: 
This phase is often considered the most time-consuming in the data mining process. It involves cleaning the data (handling missing values, removing outliers), transforming variables (e.g., normalization, encoding categorical variables), and creating derived variables.

#### Modeling: 
In this phase, various algorithms and techniques are applied to the prepared dataset to develop models. It often involves selecting the right modeling technique, building the model, and assessing the model.

#### Evaluation: 
Once models have been built, this phase ensures they meet the business objectives set in the first phase. It involves assessing the model's results against the business goals, considering possible deployment strategies, and determining if more work needs to be done.

#### Deployment: 
The final phase is about deploying the model into a real-world environment. Depending on the business needs, this could be making the model available for business analysts, integrating the model into business processes, or developing interactive visualizations and reports.
